Initial problem encountered when setting up C programming for VS Code:
1. Program, when run, is displayed on VS Code's integrated Terminal rather than Output (when compared to other setups).

Solutions found so far for:
1. Using Code Runner extension, uncheck "Code Runner: Run in Terminal" option

Extensions installed in order to work on C/C++:
1. C/C++ Extension
2. Code Runner

Processes gone through in order to work on C using VS Code:
1. MSYS2 installation (gcc and g installation, and gdb debugger)
2. mingw-w64
3. Path environment variable
